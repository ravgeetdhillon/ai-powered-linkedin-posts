The deployment was transitioned from a mixed workflow with Netlify to a fully streamlined approach leveraging Vercel deploy hooks. By removing unnecessary steps and updating the deploy cron schedule for increased frequency, we achieved a more reliable and faster path to production. This change minimizes operational friction, improves developer experience, and ensures our releases are both more predictable and maintainable. I plan to share the lessons learned and best practices for those considering a similar migration in their production workflows.\"\n",

This experience reinforced the importance of thorough validation and defensive programming when building content management platforms or any data-centric software.

Building this required deep integration with authentication and event hooks, as well as designing a user-friendly notification experience.
